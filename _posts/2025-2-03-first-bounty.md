Hello friend, in Portugal there is a popular saying that perfectly describes what happened about a week ago, "O bom filho a casa torna"(A good son always returns home).
After several duplicates and "Not Applicable" reports, I finally got my first bounty!!!!

Unfortunately, as disclosure is not allowed, I won't be able to explain how I found it.
