Hello friend, I am incredibly proud to share this achievement; My name is officially in the Hall of Fame for OlxEU, in the Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) on the Bugcrowd platform.

Unfortunately, unlike my latest posts, I can't show you the PoC of the vulnerability found, but I'll leave you with this beautiful photo that makes me very proud.
