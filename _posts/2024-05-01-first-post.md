## About Me

Hi, My name is Miguel Alves Aka Mupa and I'm 20 years old(at the moment). Yes I'm considered myself a <strong>Hacker</strong>.<br />

I started in CyberSecurity at 16 years old due to a vulnerability on Twitter that I found, the vulnerability consisted of a race condition that allowed manipulating the number of likes and followers.<br />

My goal with this website is to share my knowledge and my achievements while I keep learning, this is gonna be a long trip, so take your seat and enjoy my content!

## The Content

I'm going to upload posts about writeups and achievements (like CVE's and Certifications).

Hope you Enjoy
